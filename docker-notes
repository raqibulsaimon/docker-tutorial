Some important note:
  - in distributed application different pieces of the app is call service
  - services are just containers in production. one service one image
  - we can scale up and down or apps (replica, computer resources)

Docker development best practice:
  -How to keep images small
    > start with base images
    > can use multistage builds (means does not include all libraries and dependencies)
    > Minimize the number of RUN command to reduce the number of layers
    > If you have multiple images with a lot in common, consider creating your
      own base image with the shared components, and basing your unique images on
      that. Docker only needs to load the common layers once
    > Image layer : is read only
    > Container layer : is read and writeable
